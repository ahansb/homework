//Strings are sequences of characters
//Each character is a Unicode symbol
//Strings are stored in the dynamic memory 
//When we add strings, the string which are added remain in memory and the result remains, too. - a lot of memory is used.
//String Builder is used instead.
//Most important string processing members are:
//Length, this[], Compare(str1, str2), IndexOf(str), LastIndexOf(str), Substring(startIndex, length), 
//Replace(oldStr, newStr), Remove(startIndex, length), ToLower(), ToUpper(), Trim()
//Objects can be converted to strings and can be formatted in different styles (using ToString() method)
//Strings can be constructed by using placeholders and formatting strings (String.Format(…))
